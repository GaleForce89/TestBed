# TestBed
Random C# testing and practice going through hackerrank.com 30 days of code challenge.

#AvaloniaUI
I plan to continue testing AvaloniaUI here, this library is going to be a game changer in my mind as there is finally something
that hopefully will mature and allow cross platform ui's without the need of going to QT or GTK (mostly QT) while utilizing a modern language. Honestly thought I would never say it but I actually like c#.
